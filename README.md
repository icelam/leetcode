<h6 align="center">Summary of my Leetcode activites within past 52 weeks</h6>

---

I have been studying data structures and algorithms. As part of my commitment, I have set a personal objective to complete the daily Leetcode challenge. In order to document my progress and create a valuable resource for future reference, I have created a repository to archive all of my submissions on Leetcode. 

All the solutions in the `solutions` directory are categorized by the programming language used. Currently, I am exclusively using Java for my Leetcode practice. In the early stages of my journey, however, I initially used TypeScript along with my efforts to learn object-oriented programming. As a result, you may come across some questions that have both TypeScript and Java solutions, with slightly different algorithms.

In addition to programming languages, Leetcode also offers questions related to databases and data manipulation. As a result, you will find solutions using MySQL and Pandas for these types of questions. Lastly, there are also bash solutions available, which were used for attempting shell related questions.

List of solutions and their corresponding programming languages can be found [here](./solutions/README.md).
